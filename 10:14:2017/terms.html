<h2>rideColorado Terms of Service</h2>
<h3>Last Updated: September 17, 2017</h3>
        <p class="trm">
These terms of service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and Ride Colorado, LLC (“rideColorado,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of the rideColorado suite of services (collectively, the “rideColorado Suite”). 
            <br>
            <br>
By entering into to this Agreement, you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute resolution and arbitration provisions Section 17) and accept all of its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE RIDECOLORADO SUITE.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="trmh">The rideColorado Suite</h3>
        <p class="trm">
The rideColorado Suite provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with persons driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers and Riders are collectively referred to herein as “Travelers”. For purposes of this Agreement, the driving services provided by Drivers to Riders that are matched by Ride Colorado, LLC shall be referred to collectively as the “Services”. Any decision by a Traveler to offer or accept Services is a decision made in such Traveler’s sole discretion. Each transportation Service provided by a Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.<br></p>
        <h3 class="trmh">
Modification to the Agreement<br></h3>
        <p class="trm">
In the event rideColorado modifies the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. rideColorado reserves the right to modify any information referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the rideColorado Suite or Services after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Unless material changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration (if applicable).</p>
        <h3 class="trmh">Eligibility</h3>
<p class="trm">
The rideColorado Suite may only be used by individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. The rideColorado Suite is not available to children (persons under the age of 18) or Travelers who have had their Traveler account temporarily or permanently deactivated. By becoming a Traveler, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may not allow other persons to use your Traveler account, and you agree that you are the sole authorized traveler of your account.</p>
        
<h3 class="trmh">Charges</h3>
        <p class="trm">
As a Rider, you agree to pay the amounts agreed to for your use of the rideColorado Suite and Services (“Charges”). Charges are set by drivers and agreed to before the start of the ride, plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to pay. rideColorado has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to rideColorado.net </p>
<h3 class="trmh">Fees and Other Charges.</h3>
        <ul>
<li><p class="trm">•  Service Fee. rideColorado may assess a per-ride “Service Fee” to support the rideColorado Suite and related services provided to you by rideColorado. The amount of the Service Fee may vary but shall be retained by rideColorado in its entirety.</p></li>
<li><p class="trm">•	Cancellation Fee. After requesting a ride you may cancel it, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply.</p></li>   
<li><p class="trm">•	Damage Fee. If a Driver reports that you have materially damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250 depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by rideColorado in its sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. rideColorado reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Fee. Collected Damage Fees will be passed in their entirety to the Driver whose car was damaged. </p></li>
        </ul>
<h3 class="trmh">Payments</h3>
           <p class="trm"> 
               If you are a Driver, you may receive payment for your provision of Services. All Fare payments are determined by you and agreed to in advance. You will also receive any tips provided by Riders to you, and tips will not be subject to any rideColorado Commission.</p>
     <ul>       
<li><p class="trm">•	Commission. In exchange for permitting you to offer your Services through the rideColorado Suite and marketplace as a Driver, you may pay rideColorado (and permit rideColorado to retain) a fee based on each transaction in which you provide Services (the “Commission”). The amount of the applicable Commission will be communicated to you in a Commission Discussion, if commission is charged. rideColorado reserves the right to change the Commission at any time in rideColorado’s discretion based upon local market factors, and rideColorado will provide you with notice in the event of such change. Continued use of the rideColorado Suite after any such change in the Commission calculation shall constitute your consent to such change.
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="trmh">Pricing.
            </h3>
