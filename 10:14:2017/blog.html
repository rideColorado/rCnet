				Thanksgiving. Everyone knows it is one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.  If you're driving, take some stress out by using rideColorado to plan your trip!  If you can't do that, here are some tips and tricks to help you through the travel, so you can spend more time with your friends and family.<br>
                <br/>
                According to Waze, and reported by ABC News, Tuesday will be the most stressful travel day before Thanksgiving.  It makes sense, as people throw in the towel a day early to get a headstart on their time with family. Try to avoid driving right after work, about 5PM, as that will be the heaviest traffic.  Instead, prep your dish for Thursday, then throw it in the cooler and head out!<br>
                <br/>
                After Thanksgiving, the toughest day is predicted to be Monday, and Waze expects heavy traffic the entire day.  You aren't the only one who thinks traffic will be bad on Sunday, so you'll just head home on Monday! Instead, try to make your way back through the Eisenhower Tunnel on Saturday, or early Sunday, to beat the rush. <br>
                <br/>
                As for Colorado, <a href"https://goi70.com/travel">go i70</a> provides tips and tricks to make your trip more pleasant.  The site does not predict heavy westbound traffic over the holidays, but recommends using caution when snow is in the forecast, as it is on Tuesday, and Sunday.  Eastbound i70 may be a little trickier.  Delays are expected eastbound on Wednesday afternoon, Saturday afternoon and Sunday all day.<br>
                <br/>
                Keep checking our <a href="www.facebook.com/ridecolorado">Facebook</a> page and join our email list!  Please enjoy safe travels this Thanksgiving!  Happy Thanksgiving from us here at rideColorado.<br>

				How hard is it to build a website?

				Turns out, it's pretty hard.  To get it started it isn't too bad.  But it's not like you write just a little html and !poof! there's a website.  Well, actually, that is how it works at first. <br>
                <br>
                But putting together something like rideColorado is where it gets tricky.  We all know the goal is to provide long distance ridesharing between Denver and Breckenridge or any other Colorado towns where people are traveling.  Here's the vision behind the website to do that.  <br>
                <br>
                rideColorado is currently able to post between 5 and 10 rides a week.  Ultimately, these will be posted on a rideboard, where users will be able to get in touch with each other directly. Let's say you see a ride on the website from Denver to Silverton, and want to hop on.  You'll be able to message the driver on a public message board, set up a place and time for departure, and pay, all from rideColorado.net! <br>
                <br>
                One day, when we have an army of web developers, that we've stolen from Uber, we'll have all kinds of cool features!  There will be preferences letting other users know what music you like, if you have dogs, what luggage you have, and so on and so on.  Most importantly, you'll see what Drivers are able to carry with their cars. Do they have a ski rack? Do they have a big suv?  All these features come with time. <br>
                <br>
                For now, we're spending our limited coding time on the important stuff.  Coming soon, we'll have a login for users.  Also, we want the public rideboard to be accessible as soon as possible.  Ever read the Lean Startup?  Well, rideColorado is a believer in the philosophy and we're bringing new features at you as soon as they're available.  Until then, keep checking our <a href="www.facebook.com/ridecolorado">Facebook</a> page and join our email list!<br>

				rideColorado has one goal. That goal is to set up vehicular ridesharing for people who need to travel long distances in our state.  Today, rideColorado took a big step, by completing the first ride!  <br>
                <br>
                The ride was completed from DIA to Avon.  It is a perfect example of a rideColorado ride.  The rider landed about 9 AM in Denver and needed to get home to Avon. The Driver needed to go to Summit County, and was looking for someone to share the trip and gas with.  Everyone walked away happy!<br>
                <br>
                Next up could be you!  Use our ride-plan page to let us know when you're travelling.  We'll ask whether you are looking to ride or drive.  Drivers are in it to get some extra gas money for their trip, meet new people, and help out riders without cars.  riders are those folks who don't have a car but need to get from Denver to Avon, or wherever it is they're going. <br>
                <br>
                Once you create a ride-plan, we'll match you with other travellers who are taking the same trip as you!  The process is simple.  Drivers set their own prices and any cost will be known up front.  If you have a match, we'll put you in touch with each other through text.  You take it from there!<br>

				The first true snowstorm of the year brought powder-seekers joy yesterday.  Many of us saw the pictures of near-buried snow stakes at Arapahoe Basin and Loveland.  They are racing to open for the 2017/2018 winter season!  Also, I-70 closed because of snow for the first time this year.  The traction law was put into effect on US-6 Loveland pass at 2:10 AM on Sunday, and things went downhill from there.  <br>
                <br>
                At 10AM, a multi-vehicle crash eastbound at Silverplume began the delays.  Although the crash was cleared within a half hour, delays began.  Travel time from Silverthorne to Denver increased to 90+minutes.  By 3PM, it took over two hours to get back to Denver.  Heavy traffic continued until 5PM when the traffic began to ease back to 90 minutes.  However, the worst was yet to come.<br>
                <br>
                Multiple crashes forced I-70 to close at the Eisenhower tunnel at 5:35PM.  Then ten minutes later another crash slowed traffic eastbound at Idaho Springs.  The tunnel reopened at 6:40PM but anyone who was stuck west of Vail faced a tougher challenge ahead.  The eastbound lanes at Vail closed 7:35PM, and westbound closed at Copper 7:30PM.  People had to wait 8 hours until the road reopened at 4:00AM!<br>
                <br>
                You may be wondering where all that information came from!  It came from Twitter.  CDOT tweets their road closures and openings across the state, so you can travel smart. Follow rideColorado on <a href="https://twitter.com/ride_colorado">Twitter</a>! Beginning November 1st, we will post all i-70 alerts, so you know when to go! Also, check us out on <a href="www.facebook.com/ridecolorado">Facebook</a>. We post rides each week.  If you would like to rideshare, simply contact us to reserve your spot:  Kschoffstall@rideColorado.net or DM.<br>
                <br>
                Another great way to get involved is to join our <a href="www.ridecolorado.net">Mailing List</a>.  We send one weekly rides email which lets you know all the rides coming up that week.  It's an easy and convenient way to rideshare in Colorado.  There's nothing worse than driving in stop and go traffic, so don't! rideColorado<br>

				On Friday evening, a storm front brought the first colorado air to Colorado.  This included a dusting of snow above the treeline.  With the return of cooler weather, and ultimately ski season, it's time to discuss the vision for rideColorado.<br>
                <br>
                The idea for this company was born from an accident, literally. During winter of 2015, I crashed my car (no one was hurt, and it was a curb, not another car).  While my car was in the shop, I still wanted to take advantage of the mountains to ski and snowboard.  I was able to find a ride to and from Breckenridge EVERY WEEKEND!  The idea dawned on me; there are hundreds of drivers to carpool with to the ski resorts!<br>
                <br>
                It seems obvious, with hundreds of people going to and from the same spot, why not create a way for them to travel together, a long distance rideshare.  As winter nears, we will focus on trying to provide rides to and from the ski resorts.  Popular routes will be Denver to Vail, Denver to Summit County, and we would like to service Winter Park, Crested Butte, Telluride and more.  <br>

				Labor Day will see increased traffic accross the state, and is often one of the busiest travel days of the year.  This year, airline travel will hit a record 16.1M travelers between Aug 30th and September 5th. There is no doubt that a similar record will occur in car travel. Low unemployment, and a strong economy with rising incomes are contributing to the increased travel over the holiday.  <br>
                <br>
                It's best to avoid I-70, I-25, and 285 when travel will be at a peak.  You can expect heavy westbound traffic will start today, and run through midday tomorrow.  Also, expect eastbound traffic returning to Denver on Sunday and Monday. <br>
                <br>
                One way to avoid the traffic is to travel together!  rideColorado allows users to book their travel in advance, and share rides to the mountains, plains, lakes, and everywhere in between! Popular routes are Denver to Vail, Denver to Breckenridge, and Denver to Kansas City.

				With the solar eclipse coming on Tuesday, it's hard to escape the talk about it.  One reason people are talking is the traffic.  It may be impossible to avoid.  One Denver Post article said it will 'be like trying to drive on i-25 while 6 Bronco's games let out at the same time.' That might be true!  Thousands of Denverites are heading from Colorado to Wyoming this week for the once in a lifetime chance to see a total eclipse.<br><br>

It's going to be hard to avoid that traffic.  But there's a way to have fun in it!  With rideColorado, you can enjoy talking, music, reading, snapchatting, and instagramming by ridesharing.  Join your fellow eclipse chasers and save money and time by using rideColorado to get from Colorado to Wyoming and back! It's easy and fun to travel together.  Now your can travel with your friends, or make new friends.  <br><br>

rideColorado will help you find a ride to the big events in our area.  If you're not eclipse chasing, come back when you want to get to the 

X games, 

Winter Wondergrass, or the Meeker Sheepdog trials. If you want the flexibility of having your own car, sign up to drive!  Make some friends and make some money. There are a lot of us 

traveling 

to the same places together. Enjoy long distance ridesharing with rideColorado.

				Why does the world need another ridesharing service?  The answer is easy! There is no successful, long distance, ridesharing company. What company will help you book travel from Denver to the ski resorts, or Denver to the next big music festival? rideColorado is here to fill that gap.<br><br>

Imagine booking a car ride the way you book flights.  Need a ride from Denver to Breckenridge later this week? rideColorado.  Driving from Denver to Grand Junction next month? rideColorado.  How to get to Telluride? rideColorado.  You get the picture.

				rideColorado was formed in Colorado late on the fifth of May, 2016.  The company vision is to be the premier long distance ridesharing service in the United States.  The obvious question is, why call it rideColorado if the aim is to provide service nationwide?  <br><br>

As a one man shop, I need to focus my efforts on specific market.  By providing top of the line service to my home (Denver, CO), I can prove that this concept will work.  Then, on fund a national expansion!  You, my friends, Coloradans, and Tourists, are the reason I believe this service will improve our state.  Please help me out, all feedback is welcome!
